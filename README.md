# Hearthstone Encyclopedia

This project was created using React, styled-components, React Router, as well as the [Hearthstone API created by omgvamp](https://https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone/).

The Hearthstone Encyclopedia is a database of cards available to collect in the Blizzard Entertainment game [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us)

I was motivated to create this project to show off my proficiency in using APIs
