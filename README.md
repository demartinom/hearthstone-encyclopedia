# Hearthstone Encyclopedia

### A database of cards available to collect in the Blizzard Entertainment game [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us)

This project was created using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS as well as the [Official Hearthstone API](https://develop.battle.net/).

I was motivated to create this project to show off my proficiency in using APIs.

## Redesign

I had originally created this project using React, Styled-Components, React-Router and a third party API. I decided to rework the project into a Next.js app using the official Blizzard api.
